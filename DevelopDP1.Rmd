## My First Leaflet Map
Create a leaflet map object.
```{r cars}
library(leaflet)
map <- leaflet() %>% addTiles()
```

Create a marker with a picture of White House and a link to its wikipedia
```{r}
WhiteHouseIcon <- makeIcon(
   iconUrl = "https://i1.wp.com/www.hisour.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/The-White-House.jpg",
   iconWidth = 30*408/255, iconHeight = 30,
   iconAnchorX = 30*408/255/2, iconAnchorY = 30/2
)
```

Add the marker to the map and display the map.
```{r}
WhiteHousePopup <- c("<a href= 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_House' >White House<br><img src='https://i1.wp.com/www.hisour.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/The-White-House.jpg' width='210' height='132'  alt='White House' title='White House'></a>")
map %>%
   addTiles() %>%
   addMarkers(lat=38.8976763, lng=-77.0365298, popup = WhiteHousePopup)
```
